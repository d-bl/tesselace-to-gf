The grounds that appear in the TesseLace index are the result of research by [Veronika Irvine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220808044947/https://tesselace.com/about/) and were generated using the [TesseLace algorithm](https://web.archive.org/web/20220808044947/https://tesselace.com/research/bridges2012/).  Some of these grounds are familiar, traditional grounds.  Others have not been found in known catalogues and are likely new.

In the following tables, 
* click on the **image** to see thread and pair diagrams in [GroundForge],
* click on **txt** to download a template file for use with the bobbin lace [plugins for Inkscape](https://d-bl.github.io/inkscape-bobbinlace/),
* click on **svg** to move intersection positions around.  

Families of patterns are variations of the same pattern with [modified pin positions](/GroundForge-help/Reshape-Patterns).
Note: Currently, GroundForge does not support pin positions therefore the thread diagrams for all members of a family look the same.
